# open-source
I am going to  start contributing in open source from TODAY....GOOD LUCK
First of all u need to start learning GIT/GITHUB both things becuase this is the 1st stage of OpenSource.
Start Your 1st stage from either Docs or Video bt i would like to say 1st start from video for newely guys and for those who knew it they can skip and start searching for open source project.
